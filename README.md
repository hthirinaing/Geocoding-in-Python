Geocoding in Python with geopy
**Geocoding** is the process of converting addresses (e.g. a street or place address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude). You can geocode by entering one location description at a time or by providing many of them at once in a table. The resulting locations are output as geographic features with attributes, which can be used for mapping or spatial analysis.

You can quickly find various kinds of locations through geocoding. The types of locations that you can search for include points of interest or names from a gazetteer, like mountains, bridges, and stores and addresses, which can come in a variety of styles and formats, including street intersections, house numbers with street names, and postal codes.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to perform geocoding in Python with the help of Geopy library. Let's install these libraries with Pip if you have already Anaconda environment setup.
